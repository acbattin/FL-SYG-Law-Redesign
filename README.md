# FL-SYG-Law-Redesign
Redesign the Reuters "Gun deaths in Florida" plot in order to more accurately portray information regarding the efficacy of the 2005 passage of the Stand Your Ground law in Florida and the 2017 amendment. 

# Background Context
The Stand Your Ground (SYG) law was introduced as a senate bill in the Florida (FL) legislature in 2005 and was enacted that same year making Florida (FL) the first state with a SYG law. The SYG law was presented as a self-defense law that removes the duty to retreat and was aimed to shift the balance of power in favor of the victims. The legal repercussions of this law have played out on the national news with critics of this expansion on traditional common law principal of the castle doctrine and there have been few amendments made since the law’s passage in 2005.

# Methods
* I pulled the Florida Uniform Crime Reports from the official Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s (FDLE) publicly accessible online database linked on their department’s website. These are annually updated reports. I downloaded the  reports from 1990 to the most recently available report, 2020, and compiled the data into an Excel file and properly formatted the data types.
